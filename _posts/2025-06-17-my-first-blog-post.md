## Restart of my java developer career after long career gap

In this post, I'm kicking off my career journey with some interview prep and sharing daily achievements, so that I can ace those interviews together. 

There's a great saying **The best way of learning is by teaching!** here I am learning through my blog post. I'll be sharing my prep journey, 

different topics which i covered time based, coding challenges through daily and weekly . 

I'm not sure how long it'll take to nail the interview, but I need to brush up on my core and technical skills asap 

and crush the interview.

## Restart of my java developer career after long career gap and interview preparation

In this post, I'm kicking off my career journey with some interview prep and sharing daily achievements, so that I can ace those interviews together.

There's a great saying **The best way of learning is by teaching!** here I am learning through my blog post. I'll be sharing my prep journey,

different topics which i covered time based, coding challenges through daily and weekly .

I'm not sure how long it'll take to nail the interview, but I need to brush up on my core and technical skills asap

and crush the interview.
